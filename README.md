# XML TEI Encoding Project for the Georges de Cr√©qui-Montfort Scientific Mission Archive

This project develops a TEI-compliant XML encoding scheme for archival documents held at the National Archives. It focuses on materials related to the 1904 scientific mission led by Georges de Cr√©qui-Montfort in South America and the ethnographic and archaeological collections it assembled. The archive comprises correspondence, including letters exchanged between mission members and the Ministry of Higher Education and Fine Arts, as well as communications with Parisian museum curators.

The source files are transcriptions of original letters in `.txt` format. Encoding these in TEI XML provides a structured digital representation, enabling researchers to analyze the roles of individuals, institutions, and the timeline of events surrounding the collection‚Äôs acquisition and distribution. Archival documents span 1903‚Äì1912, reflecting the mission‚Äôs organization, execution, and the management of its artifacts, which were distributed to regional museums across France.

## Project Features

- ‚úâÔ∏è **Source Files**: Letters transcribed in `.txt` and encoded in TEI XML.
- üìú **ODD Document**: A custom TEI ODD defines the schema, focusing on correspondence-specific elements.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Relax NG Schema**: Generated from the ODD to validate encoded documents.
- üìö **Documentation**: Comprehensive guidelines for encoding and schema usage.
- üìÑ **XML Encodings**: Uniformly structured documents aligned with the custom TEI schema.

## Schema Design

The schema is specifically adapted for encoding letters and identifying key elements such as places, individuals, and organizations involved in the mission. This structure allows researchers to trace geographic movements, analyze institutional roles, and better understand the mission‚Äôs historical context.

This repository provides a foundation for exploring the history of scientific expeditions, museum collections, and cultural heritage in France.
